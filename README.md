## Description

This website has a form with the ability to grow the form. When the user is done creating a list of groceries the page will then take the inputs from the form and put them into an array to be alphabetized and then output to the page. If the user decides that they made a mistake they can add more to the list or modify what they put in and resubmit the form again, and the page will clear the old list and create a new one and print it in the old one's place.
